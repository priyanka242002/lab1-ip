    <center><b><i>You need only a passing interest in New Orleans to be aware of its proud, carefree approach to life. 
                The motto of New Orleans is “laissez les bon temps rouler”, a crude English to Cajun-French translation of “let the good times roll,” and a prime example of why sentiment should always take precedence over grammar.
           This New Orleans slogan isn’t something just slapped on the end of tourism campaigns, either. It’s something you can see and feel around the city.
